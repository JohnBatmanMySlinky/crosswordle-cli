# crosswordle-cli

A very simple cli implementation of [crosswordle](https://crosswordle.serializer.ca) in python. 

You'll probably want to add to `crosswordle/word_list.txt`...

# Use
```python
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd crosswordle
python main.py
```

# TODO
- how do you know which word is 1 & which is 2???
- display # of letters somewhere
- include dictionary look up
- make yellow look ups better
